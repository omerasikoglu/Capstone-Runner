# Rollic Bootcamp Capstone Project

To be able to graduate from Rollic's [bootcamp](https://www.patika.dev/bootcamp/hyper-casual-mobile-game-art-development-bootcamp), this capstone project process was organized. Feminine Runner Games were determined as the theme for the games to be developed. Inspired by this theme, each team developed their own hypercasual game by using Unity 3D. 

## Game Idea

After reviewing various hit feminine concept runner games, we designed our game based on the princess vs witch concept that everyone has known since childhood.
